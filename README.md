### ✨ Key Features

* **📊 All-in-One Trend Analysis:** Combines multiple moving averages, Bollinger Bands, and VWAP into a single, cohesive indicator, reducing chart clutter.
* **🧠 Normalized Hull MA Engine:** Utilizes a custom, smoothed, triple-Hull Moving Average (`hma3`) as its core trend engine, designed to be faster and smoother than traditional MAs.
* **🟢🔴 Clear Visual Signals:** Plots the main trend with color-coded lines (lime for uptrend, red for downtrend) and marks potential entry points with crossover shapes directly on the chart.
* **🌊 Optional Kahlman Filter Smoothing:** Includes an integrated Kahlman filter to further smooth the trend line and reduce market noise for a clearer long-term view.
* **🔔 Built-in Trading Alerts:** Comes with pre-configured alert conditions for "Long" or "Short" crossover signals, so you never miss a potential entry.
* **⚙️ Fully Customizable Inputs:** Allows for complete customization of all parameters, including MA lengths, MA types (EMA, SMA, etc.), sources, BB deviation, and VWAP settings to fit any trading strategy.
